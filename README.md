**I'm currently on the job market looking for new grad opportunities in fullstack, backend and infrastructure development**. 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a recent graduate of the University of Utah where I received my BS Computer Science and MS Human Centered Computing(Visualization, HCI, Systems programming). 



My current interests include machine learning, designing and building visual tools and interfaces for interacting with data, and learning about scalable data systems and algorithms like RAFT, MapReduce, and Spanner. 

Outside of programming I like to play piano, write film reviews and explore the outdoors.
