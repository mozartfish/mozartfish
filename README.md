ðŸ‘‹ Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a BS/MS candidate at the [University of Utah School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) studying distributed systems, 
software engineering and data visualization. Previously, I was a member of the [Utah Visualization Design Lab](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/) where
I worked on [MultiMatrix](https://github.com/multinet-app/multimatrix) and [MultiAggr](https://mozartfish.github.io/assets/MultiAggr.pdf) as part of the NSF [MultiNet Project](https://github.com/multinet-app) to create tools for visualizing multivariate networks. Currently I am working on
implementing a Fault Tolerant Key Value Store built on top of [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/) along with some other distributed systems projects.

Here on my GitHub profile, you'll find mostly visualization and web projects since those are the only ones I can share publicly but I have projects
related to custom programming languages, distributed systems (MapReduce, Raft, Key Value Store), operating systems (modified xv6) that I can share upon request.

I like working across all aspects of the technical stack and I am currently using a combination of the following languages and tools for projects:
**D3** for visuals, **JavaScript, Python** for analysis and data wrangling, **Golang** for distributed systems, **JavaScript/TypeScript, Vue** for frontend
and **Python, Golang, C++** for general programming.

**Projects**
Distributed Systems
- Map Reduce
- RAFT (Elections, Replication, Persistence)
- KVRaft - Key-Value Store built on top of my RAFT implementation
Visualization/Front End
- GapMinder
- MultiAggr
- FIFA 2018 Match Summary 
Operating Systems
- xv6-6460 
Programming Languages
- Curly DSL (Imperative Programming, Types, Functional Programming)



If you'd like to ask questions about my process and projects, collaborate on a project or are hiring new grad software engineering positions, feel free
