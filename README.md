# Hi! I'm Pranav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a current machine learning student at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I aspire to build tools and platforms that make data and models more accessible and interpretable. In particular, I am excited about working at the intersection of machine learning, math, interactive visualization, data science and software engineering to help solve problems across data domains. 

Outside of school and work, I love classical music, movies, the outdoors, cooking and meeting new people.
