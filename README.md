ðŸ‘‹ Hi, nice to meet you! I'm currently on the job market applying for new grad jobs in backend and fullstack development. Currently Iâ€™m working on deepening my understanding of golang and web programming. Iâ€™m excited about working across all aspects of the technical stack especially working on software tools to improve developer experience and end-user application experience. 

I completed my BS Computer Science and MS Computing degrees from the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) where I studied among other things systems programming (programming languages, distributed systems, operating systems), human-data interaction (data visualization, human-computer interaction, data mining), software engineering and piano performance. From 2020 - 2021 I was a member of the [Utah Visualization Design Lab](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/) where I worked on [MultiMatrix](https://github.com/multinet-app/multimatrix) and [MultiAggr](https://mozartfish.github.io/assets/MultiAggr.pdf) as part of the NSF [MultiNet Project](https://github.com/multinet-app) to create software tools for network visualization

Here on my GitHub profile youâ€™ll find some of my work including a networked spreadsheet, networked video game, a custom FFMPEG format, visualization projects with D3.js and more. Additionally I have projects related to custom programming languages, distributed systems (MapReduce, Raft, Key Value Store) that I can share upon request.

If you'd like to ask questions about my process and projects, collaborate on a project or are hiring new grad software engineering positions, feel free 
to reach out via  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thegreenveggie_) or [email](mailto:rajan.pranav320@gmail.com).
