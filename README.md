ðŸ‘‹ Hi, nice to meet you! I'm currently on the job market applying for new grad jobs in backend and fullstack development.

Previously, I completed my BS and MS Computing(Human-Centered Computing) at the [University of Utah School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) where I studied distributed systems, visualization, software engineering and programming languages. From 2020-2021 I was a member of the [Utah Visualization Design Lab](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/) where 
I worked on [MultiMatrix](https://github.com/multinet-app/multimatrix) and [MultiAggr](https://mozartfish.github.io/assets/MultiAggr.pdf) as part of the NSF [MultiNet Project](https://github.com/multinet-app) to create tools for visualizing multivariate networks.

Here on my GitHub profile, you'll find mostly visualization and web projects since those are the only ones I can share publicly but I have projects
related to custom programming languages, distributed systems (MapReduce, Raft, Key Value Store), operating systems (modified xv6) that I can share upon request.

I like working across all aspects of the technical stack and I am currently using a combination of the following languages and tools for projects:
**D3** for visuals, **JavaScript, Python** for analysis and data wrangling, **Golang** for distributed systems, **JavaScript/TypeScript, Svelte** for frontend and **Python, Golang, C++** for general programming.

If you'd like to ask questions about my process and projects, collaborate on a project or are hiring new grad software engineering positions, feel free 
to reach out via  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thegreenveggie_) or [email](mailto:rajan.pranav320@gmail.com).
