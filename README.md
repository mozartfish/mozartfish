# Hi! I'm Pranav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year machine learning student at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am broadly interested in machine learning, systems, visual computing, human-ai interaction especially their intersection. I'm particuarly interested in how we can use visualization, unsupervised learning and ideas from systems, nlp, information retrieval, and big data processing to find structure and patterns in unstructured datasets. 

Outside of school and work, I love classical music, movies, the outdoors, cooking and meeting new people. 

**Work + Research Interests**: *Machine Learning*, *Information Retrieval*, *Generative Modeling*,  *Interactive Visualization*, *Deep Learning*, *Natural Language Processing*, *Tooling*, *High-Dimensional Data*, *Embeddings*
